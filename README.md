# Exercism C# Track Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the [Exercism C# track](https://exercism.org/tracks/csharp).

## Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own directory, named after the exercise. Each directory typically contains:

- `ExerciseName.cs` - My solution to the exercise.
- `ExerciseNameTests.cs` - Unit tests for the exercise (provided by Exercism).
- Additional files as required by the exercise.

## Usage

To run the tests for a specific exercise:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory.
2. Use the following command to run the tests:

```bash
exercism test
